## What is Puruto?

Puruto is a **development framework for building agentic applications**. It defines a standard for packaging apps so that any code agent can understand and run them — without additional configuration.

The core idea: **the repository is the application**. The agent reads the repo, knows who it is, what it can do, and how to behave.

  <Card title="Open standard" icon="puzzle">
    Built on the **SKILL.md** format, adopted by Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex and Windsurf since December 2025. Write once, run on any agent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Local ecosystem" icon="laptop">
    Everything lives in `~/purutos/`. No cloud, no subscriptions. Your data, your machine, your rules.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Generator included" icon="rocket">
    One command creates a complete, functional Puruto repo: `CLAUDE.md`, `agent.md`, 4 base skills, `.env.example` and README — all working from day one.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Composable" icon="add-document">
    Connect Purutos to each other with agentic IPC. `puruto-data` as a data vault, `puruto-telegram` as a mobile connector.
  </Card>

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone the framework
git clone https://github.com/pepetox/puruto.git && cd puruto

# 2. Install generator dependency
pip install jinja2

# 3. Open in your agent and initialize the ecosystem
/init

# 4. Create your first app
/puruto-generator
```
